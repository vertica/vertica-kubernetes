# Config file for when we run and generate kustomize (used in
# setup-kustomize.sh).  This file is always read as the base

# the KUSTOMIZE_CFG environment variable to point to it.

# We have a set of default images to use in case the image environment
# variables are not set.

# Endpoint and credentials for s3 communal access in the tests.  These defaults

# Set these when using a custom endpoint with Azure (e.g. when connecting to
# azurite).  The first one is the host:port combo and the second is either http
# or https.

# When using Azurite, the host must be either an IP address or a single word

# Communal path components.
#
# For a given testcase name 'tcName', the full path is:
#   ${PATH_PROTOCOL}${BUCKET_OR_CLUSTER}${PATH_PREFIX}tcName
#
# The next set of options allow you to set the different parts of the path.
#
# The protocol to be used when generating the communal path.
#
# Valid values are: s3://, gs://, azb://, /
#
# Using / implies the use of a hostpath.
PATH_PROTOCOL=s3://

# This serves a few different purposes, depending on the scheme:
# - If using s3 or google cloud storage, this is the name of the bucket.
# - If using azure, this is the account name.
# - If using hostpath, this is the directory, relative the root where the
#   hostpath is found. This is a path found on each k8s node.
BUCKET_OR_CLUSTER=nimbusdb

# This is used to place the communal path in a subdirectory.  In order to form
# a valid path, it must always begin and end with a slash.
#
# If using a hostPath to store communal storage in a POSIX path, this is in the
# hostpath mount where communal storage is located.

# When using hostpath for communal storage, this acts as the subpath within the
# hostmount where the communal storage is to be kept.

# This setting can be used if you want to apply the server mount patch.  This

# When using kind, the default provisioner doesn't allow volume expansion.
