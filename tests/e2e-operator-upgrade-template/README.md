These are e2e tests for upgrading the operator from an old
release to the current release.  These cannot be run in parallel
since it involves installing the old CRD.

The files in this directory act as a template.  The actual testcase is in
e2e-operator-upgrade-overlays.  Those testcases are generated with the
setup-operator-upgrade-testsuite.sh.  Each testsuite is generated by taking the
contents of template/ and then adding the files in a specific test dir
(i.e. from-1.3.1/).
