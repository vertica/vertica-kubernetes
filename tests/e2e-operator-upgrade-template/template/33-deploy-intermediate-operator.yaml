# In v1.7 operator, we added support for VDB api v1 and deprecated api v1beta1
# Any VDB saved as v1beta1 would be auto-converted to v1
#
# In v25.3 operator, we fully removed support for v1beta1
#
# However, if we have a VDB created before 1.7, it will be still be in v1beta1
# Thus, directly upgrading operator from <1.7 to >=25.3 will not work
#
# Instead, we do an intermediate upgrade in between
# This intermediate upgrade is currently v2.0.0
