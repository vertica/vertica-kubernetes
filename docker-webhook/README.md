# What is webhook?

Webhook is also called "admission controller", which is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request is authenticated and authorized.

# How to Use This Image

This image is used to deploy the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) for the Vertica operator. The admission controller is a cluster-scoped webhook that prevents invalid state changes to the custom resource instance. When you save a change to a custom resource instance, the admission controller webhook queries a REST endpoint that provides state rules for custom resource objects. If a change violates the state rules, the admission controller prevents the change and returns a error.

See the [Vertica GitHub repository](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes) for a brief overview on how to install and configure the operator. See the [Vertica documentation](https://www.vertica.com/docs/11.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/Containers/ContainerizedVertica.htm) for an in-depth look at the Vertica on Kubernetes architecture.
