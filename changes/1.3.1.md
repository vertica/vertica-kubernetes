## 1.3.1 - 2022-03-02
### Fixed
* [#164](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/164) Order the environment variables that were converted from annotations.  Prior to this fix, it was quite easy to get the statefulset controller to go into a repeated rolling upgrade.  The order ensures the statefulset doesn't appear to change between reconcile cycles.
* [#161](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/161) Tolerate slashes being at the end of the communal endpoint url
