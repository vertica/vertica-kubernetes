* [#87](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/87) Support for Google Cloud Storage (gs://) as a communal endpoint.
* [#87](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/87) Support for HDFS (webhdfs://) as a communal endpoint.
* [#88](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/88) Support for HDFS (swebhdfs://) as a communal endpoint.
* [#89](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/89) Added the ability to specify custom volume mounts for use within the Vertica container.
* [#91](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/91) Support for Kerberos authentication
* [#94](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/94) Ability to specify custom ssh keys
* [#59](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/59) New initPolicy called ScheduleOnly.  Use this policy when you have a vertica cluster running outside of Kubernetes and you want to provision new nodes to run inside Kubernetes.  Most of the automation is disabled when running in this mode.
### Removed
* [#88](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/88) Removed support for Vertica 10.1.1.  The operator only supports Vertica 11.0.0 or higher.
### Fixed
* [#90](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/90) Timing with scale down that can cause corruption in admintools.conf
* [#99](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/99) The RollingUpdate strategy can kick-in after an image change causing pods in the cluster to restart again.
* [#101](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/101) The image change can be marked complete before we finish the restart of the pods.
* [#113](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/113) Restart of a cluster that has nodes in read-only state.  This is needed to run the operator with Vertica version 11.0.2 or newer.
