kind: Changed
body: Start the admission controller webhook as part of the operator pod.  This removes
  the helm chart and container for the webhook.  To order to use the webhook with the namespace
  scoped operator, the NamespaceDefaultLabelName feature gate must be enabled (on
  by default in 1.21+) or the namespace must have the label 'kubernetes.io/metadata.name=<nsName>'
  set.
