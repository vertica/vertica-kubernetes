## 1.1.0 - 2021-10-24
### Added
* [#42](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/42) Added the ability to specify custom volumes for use within sidecars.
* [#57](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/57) Added the ability to specify a custom CA file to authenticate s3 communal storage over https.  Previously https was only allowed for AWS.
* [#54](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/54) Added the ability to mount additional certs in the Vertica container.  These certs can be specified through the new '.spec.certSecrets' parameter.
### Changed
* [#39](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/39) Calls to update_vertica are removed.  The operator will modify admintools.conf for install/uninstall now.  This speeds up the time it takes to scale out.
* [#43](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/43) Start the admission controller webhook as part of the operator pod.  This removes the helm chart and container for the webhook.  To order to use the webhook with the namespace scoped operator, the NamespaceDefaultLabelName feature gate must be enabled (on by default in 1.21+) or the namespace must have the label 'kubernetes.io/metadata.name=<nsName>' set.
* [#46](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/46) Relax the dependency that the webhook requires cert-manager.  The default behaviour is to continue to depend on cert-manager.  But we now allow custom certs to be added through new helm chart parameters.
* [#51](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/51) The operator automatically follows the upgrade procedure when the '.spec.image' is changed.  This removes the upgrade-vertica.sh script that previously handled this outside of the operator.
### Fixed
* [#47](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/47) Communal storage on AWS s3.  The timeouts the operator had set were too low preventing a create DB from succeeding.
* [#58](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/58) Increased the memory limit for the operator pod and made it configurable as a helm parameter.
* [#61](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues/61) Allow the AWS region to be specified in the CR.
