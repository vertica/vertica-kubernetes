# What is Vertica?

Vertica is a unified analytics platform, based on a massively scalable architecture with the broadest set of analytical functions spanning event and time series, pattern matching, geospatial and end-to-end in-database machine learning. Vertica enables you to easily apply these powerful functions to the largest and most demanding analytical workloads, arming you and your customers with predictive business insights faster than any analytics data warehouse in the market. Vertica provides a unified analytics platform across major public clouds and on-premises data centers and integrates data in cloud object storage and HDFS without forcing you to move any of your data.

# How to Use This Image

This image is used to deploy the VerticaDB operator. The operator manages a Vertica [Eon Mode](https://www.vertica.com/docs/11.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/Eon/Architecture.htm) database in Kubernetes, and automates the following administrative tasks:
- Installing Vertica
- Creating and reviving a Vertica database
- Restarting and rescheduling DOWN pods to maintain quorum
- Subcluster scaling
- Service management and health monitoring for pods
- Load balancing for internal and external traffic

Vertica recommends that you download the [docker-webhook](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/tree/main/docker-webhook) image to install the [admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) with the operator. The admission controller uses a webhook to verify changes to mutable states in a custom resource instance.

For a brief overview on how to install and configure the operator, see the [Vertica GitHub repository](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes). For an in-depth look at Vertica on Kubernetes, see the [Vertica documentation](https://www.vertica.com/docs/11.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/Containers/ContainerizedVertica.htm).
