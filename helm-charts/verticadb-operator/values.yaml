  # The webhook requires a TLS certficate to work.  By default we rely on
  # cert-manager to be installed as we use it generate the cert.  cert-manager
  # can be installed with this command:
  # kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.3/cert-manager.yaml

  # If you don't want to use cert-manager, you need to specify your own cert,
  # which you can do with the next two parameters.

  # tlsSecret is a name of a secret in the same namespace the chart is being
  # installed in.  The secret must have the keys: tls.key, ca.crt, and tls.crt.

  # If true, the webhook will be enabled and its configuration is setup by the helm chart. 
  # Setting this to false will disable the webhook. The webhook setup needs privileges to add 
  # validatingwebhookconfiguration and mutatingwebhookconfiguration, both are cluster scoped.

  # can be used to skip that and still deploy the operator.

  # Moreover dev mode disables sampling.
