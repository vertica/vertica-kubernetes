webhook:
  # The webhook requires a TLS certificate to work. This parm defines how the
  # cert is supplied. Valid values are:
  # - internal: The certs are generated internally by the operator prior to
  #      starting the managing controller. The generated cert is self-signed.
  #      When it expires, the operator pod will need to be restarted in order
  #      to generate a new certificate. This is the default.
  # - cert-manager: The certs are generated using the cert-manager operator.
  #      This operator needs to be deployed before deploying the operator. It
  #      can be installed with this command:
  #      kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.5.3/cert-manager.yaml
  #
  #      Deployment of this chart will create a self-signed cert. The advantage
  #      of this over 'internal' is that cert-manager will automatically handle
  #      private key rotation when the certificate is about to expire.
  # - secret: The certs are created prior to installation of this chart and are
  #      provided to the operator through a secret. This option gives you the
  #      most flexibility as it is entirely up to you how the cert is created.
  #      This option requires the webhook.tlsSecret option to be set. For
  #      backwards compatibility, if webhook.tlsSecret is set, it is implicit
  #      that this mode is selected.
  certSource: internal
  # Use this parameter if you want to provide your own cert. tlsSecret is a
  # name of a secret in the same namespace the chart is being installed in.
  # The secret must have the keys: tls.key and tls.crt. It can also include the
  # key ca.crt. When that key is included the operator will patch it into the CA
  # bundle in the webhook configuration.
  #
  # For backwards compatibility, if this is set, then 'certSource = secret' is
  # implied.
  tlsSecret: ""
  # caBundle is a PEM encoded CA bundle that will be used to validate the
  # webhook's server certificate.
  #
  # This is another way to provide the CA bundle to be patched with in the
  # webhook configuration. This approach is deprecated in favour of providing
  # the CA bundle in the tlsSecret with the ca.crt key. This option will be
  # removed in a future release.
  caBundle: ""
  # If true, the webhook will be enabled and its configuration is setup by the helm chart. 
  # Setting this to false will disable the webhook. The webhook setup needs privileges to add 
  # validatingwebhookconfiguration and mutatingwebhookconfiguration, both are cluster scoped. 
  # If you do not have necessary privileges to add these configurations, then this option 
  # can be used to skip that and still deploy the operator.

  # Moreover dev mode disables sampling.

prometheus:
  # Controls exposing of the prometheus metrics endpoint.  Valid options are:
  #
  # EnableWithAuthProxy: A new service object will be created that exposes the
  #    metrics endpoint.  Access to the metrics are controlled by rbac rules
  #    using the proxy (see https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy).  The
  #    metrics endpoint will use the https scheme.
  # EnableWithoutAuth: Like EnableWithAuthProxy, this will create a service
  #    object to expose the metrics endpoint.  However, there is no authority
  #    checking when using the endpoint.  Anyone who had network access
  #    endpoint (i.e. any pod in k8s) will be able to read the metrics.  The
  #    metrics endpoint will use the http scheme.
  # Disable: Prometheus metrics are not exposed at all.
  expose: EnableWithAuthProxy

  # If prometheus is exposed with an auth proxy (EnableWithAuthProxy), use this
  # parameter to control what certificates are used for the https endpoint. If
  # this is empty, the operator will use a generated self-signed cert. When

  # endpoint.
