This helm chart will install the operator and an admission controller webhook.  The following table describes the configuration parameters for this chart.  Refer to the helm documentation on how to set these parameters.

| Parameter Name | Description | Default Value |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| affinity | The [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) parameter allows you to constrain the operator pod only to specific nodes. If this parameter is not set, then no affinity setting is used with the operator pod. | Not set |
| image.name | The name of image that runs the operator. | vertica/verticadb-operator:2.0.1 |
| image.repo | Repo server hosting image.name | docker.io |
| image.pullPolicy | The pull policy for the image that runs the operator  | IfNotPresent |
| imagePullSecrets | List of Secret names containing login credentials for above repos | null (pull images anonymously) |
| logging.filePath | The path to the log file. If omitted, all logging will be written to stdout.  | |
| logging.maxFileSize | The maximum size, in MB, of the logging file before log rotation occurs. This is only applicable if logging to a file. | 500 |
| logging.maxFileAge | The maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the timestamp encoded in the file. This is only applicable if logging to a file. |
| logging.maxFileRotation | The maximum number of files that are kept in rotation before the old ones are removed. This is only applicable if logging to a file. | 3 |
| logging.level | The minimum logging level. Valid values are: debug, info, warn, and error | info |
| logging.dev | Enables development mode if true and production mode otherwise. | false |
| nameOverride | Setting this allows you to control the prefix of all of the objects created by the helm chart.  If this is left blank, we use the name of the chart as the prefix | |
| nodeSelector | The [node selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) provides control over which nodes are used to schedule a pod. If this parameter is not set, the node selector is omitted from the pod that is created by the operator's Deployment object. To set this parameter, provide a list of key/value pairs. | Not set |
| priorityClassName | The [priority class name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass) that is assigned to the operator pod. This affects where the pod gets scheduled. | Not set |
| prometheus.createProxyRBAC | Set this to false if you want to avoid creating the rbac rules for accessing the metrics endpoint when it is protected by the rbac auth proxy.  By default, we will create those RBAC rules. | true |
| prometheus.createServiceMonitor | Set this to true if you want to create a ServiceMonitor.  This object is a CR provided by the prometheus operator to allow for easy service discovery.  If set to true, the prometheus operator must be installed before installing this chart.<br> See: https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator<br><br>*This parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.* | false |
| prometheus.expose | Controls exposing of the prometheus metrics endpoint.  Valid options are:<br><br>- **EnableWithAuthProxy**: A new service object will be created that exposes the metrics endpoint.  Access to the metrics are controlled by rbac rules using the proxy (see https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy). The metrics endpoint will use the https scheme.<br><br>- **EnableWithoutAuth**: Like EnableWithAuthProxy, this will create a service object to expose the metrics endpoint.  However, there is no authority checking when using the endpoint.  Anyone who has network access to the endpoint (i.e. any pod in k8s) will be able to read the metrics.  The metrics endpoint will use the http scheme.<br><br>- **Disable**: Prometheus metrics are not exposed at all.  | EnableWithAuthProxy |
| prometheus.tlsSecret | Use this if you want to provide your own certs for the prometheus metrics endpoint. It refers to a secret in the same namespace that the helm chart is deployed in.  The secret must have the following keys set:<br><br>- **tls.key** – private key<br>- **tls.crt** – cert for the private key<br>- **ca.crt** – CA certificate<br><br>The prometheus.expose=EnableWithAuthProxy must be set for the operator to use the certs provided. If this field is omitted, the RBAC proxy sidecar will generate its own self-signed cert. | "" |
| reconcileConcurrency.eventtrigger | Set this to control the concurrency of reconciliations of EventTrigger CRs | 1 |
| reconcileConcurrency.verticaautoscaler | Set this to control the concurrency of reconciliations of VerticaAutoscaler CRs | 1 |
| reconcileConcurrency.verticadb | Set this to control the concurrency of reconciliations of VerticaDB CRs | 5 |
| rbac_proxy_image.name | Image name of Kubernetes RBAC proxy. | kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.13.1 |
| rbac_proxy_image.repo | Repo server hosting rbac_proxy_image.name | gcr.io |
| resources.\* | The resource requirements for the operator pod. | <pre>limits:<br>  cpu: 100m<br>  memory: 750Mi<br>requests:<br>  cpu: 100m<br>  memory: 20Mi</pre> |
| serviceAccountAnnotations | A map of annotations that will be added to the serviceaccount created. | |
| serviceAccountNameOverride | Controls the name given to the serviceaccount that is created. | |
| tolerations | Any [tolerations and taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) used to influence where a pod is scheduled. This parameter is provided as a list. | Not set |
| webhook.caBundle | A PEM encoded CA bundle that will be used to validate the webhook's server certificate.  This option is deprecated in favour of providing the CA bundle in the webhook.tlsSecret with the ca.crt key. This option will be removed in a future release.| |
| webhook.certSource | The webhook requires a TLS certificate to work. This parm defines how the cert is supplied. Valid values are:<br><br>- **internal**: The certs are generated internally by the operator prior to starting the managing controller. The generated cert is self-signed. When it expires, the operator pod will need to be restarted in order to generate a new certificate. This is the default.<br><br>- **cert-manager**: The certs are generated using the cert-manager operator.  This operator needs to be deployed before deploying the operator. Deployment of this chart will create a self-signed cert through cert-manager. The advantage of this over 'internal' is that cert-manager will automatically handle private key rotation when the certificate is about to expire.<br><br>- **secret**: The certs are created prior to installation of this chart and are provided to the operator through a secret. This option gives you the most flexibility as it is entirely up to you how the cert is created.  This option requires the webhook.tlsSecret option to be set. For backwards compatibility, if webhook.tlsSecret is set, it is implicit that this mode is selected. | internal |
| webhook.tlsSecret | The webhook requires a TLS certficate to work. By default we create a cert internally. If you want full control over the cert that is created you can use this parameter to provide it. When set, it is a name of a secret in the same namespace the chart is being installed in.  The secret must have the keys: tls.key and tls.crt. It can also include the key ca.crt. When that key is included the operator will patch it in the CA bundle in the webhook configuration.| |
| webhook.enable | If true, the webhook will be enabled and its configuration is setup by the helm chart. Setting this to false will disable the webhook. The webhook setup needs privileges to add validatingwebhookconfiguration and mutatingwebhookconfiguration, both are cluster scoped. If you do not have necessary privileges to add these configurations, then this option can be used to skip that and still deploy the operator. | true |
