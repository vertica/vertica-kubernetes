  # patches here are for enabling the CA injection for each CRD
  # SPILLY - disable the cainjection. This was preventing server side apply because a `make install` would try to modify the annotation that the helm chart added. I need to know if cert-manager is still a viable option. If we can remove it, then we are good to remove this stuff here.
